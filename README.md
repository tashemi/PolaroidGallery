Polaroid Gallery Up
===================

WP plugin for showing photos as polaroid gallery.
Author of this plugin is janisto. Original plugin directory in wordpress plugins gallery is http://wordpress.org/plugins/polaroid-gallery/
Plugin was not maintained since 2 years. I did not find way to reach autor of plugin to add my fixes. 
Thanks to autor plugin is [unlicensed](http://unlicense.org/). So I've forked it.
